        <h1>Anand Atwal</h1>
        <p>Hi! Welcome to my website. Here you will be able to discover, learn and gain an insight on myself, salesforce and
            my journey in my salesforce apprenticeship so far.</p>
        <div class="Anandos">
            <section id="about">
                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>From the first instance where I received an email offer from Step Forward for an apprenticeship role, I sensed
                    an opportunity which would take me out of the rut that I found myself in at college after retaking a
                    year. However, I could never have imagined the prospects of my journey with Step Forward to be as far-reaching
                    and exciting as it has been. When I started the process, I found myself to be quite apprehensive and
                    nervous. My situation at college, retaking a year, left me in a dilemma – choosing between an apprenticeship
                    in a pathway I was passionate about, or continuing in a course I was good at.</p>

                <p>The interview was an experience in itself, where I had to learn many skills through extreme preparation.
                    One skill I developed was the ability to think and plan quickly. Directly before I entered my first interview,
                    I was prompted to speak about a subject with only two minutes preparation, which was both scary and rewarding.
                    An aspect of personal development which I gained was thinking outside of the box and learning how to
                    plan for an interview. I quickly improved my knowledge of Step Forward as an organization, and my confidence
                    was solidified as I walked into the interview room.
                </p>

                <p>My work experience so far with my company Audio Network has been extremely fun and rewarding. My responsibilities
                    involve communicating with everyone in the company who uses Salesforce in order to configure it for their
                    needs. It includes training new Salesforce users as well, in the UK, America and Australia.</p>

                <p>The social aspect of work has by far been my favorite thing. Everybody is treated equally and everyone is
                    on the same level – especially when it comes to supporting one another and celebrating! I think my future
                    at Salesforce looks bright. Step Forward has given me the opportunity to achieve qualifications for Salesforce
                    that compliment my role in the workplace. I am fortunate to gain all of this experience with the support
                    of Step Forward, and the programme has already given me an early potential career with my company.</p>

                <p>Salesforce, Audio Network and Step Forward have helped me meet people, network and learn about how other
                    people use Salesforce. I’ve grown though training and through attending events, such as Salesforce administrator
                    meet-ups and conferences such as Cloudfest.</p>

                <p>My experience at Cloudfest was very interesting, as I was able to broaden my knowledge of an incredibly diverse
                    range of companies, whilst representing Step Forward as an associate. Overall, I feel very excited to
                    be in such a great position at 18 years old, where I have unwavering support from my mentors in Step
                    Forward and a great relationship with everyone in the company I work for.</p>
